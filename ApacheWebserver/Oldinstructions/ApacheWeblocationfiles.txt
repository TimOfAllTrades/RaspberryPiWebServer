In my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the document root was set to /var/www/html. It was configured in the following file:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
So just do a

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
and change the following line to what you want:

DocumentRoot /var/www/html
Also do a

sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
and find this:

<Directory /var/www/html/>
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
Require all granted
</Directory>
And change /var/www/html to your preferred directory and save it.

After you saved your changes, just restart the Apache 2 web server and you'll be done :)

sudo service apache2 restart
