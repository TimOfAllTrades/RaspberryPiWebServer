Type in the command 'sudo apt-get install motion ' to start the installation.

Now to make sure that the camera is correctly detected.

After the installation is complete, type in the command ' sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf ' and press enter.

Then you have to change some settings in the .conf file. It might be difficult sometimes to find the settings but use 'ctrl + w' to find it. So follow the steps:

Make sure 'daemon' is ON.
Set 'framerate' anywhere in between 1000 to 1500.
Keep 'Stream_port' to 8081.
'Stream_quality' should be 100.
Change 'Stream_localhost' to OFF.
Change 'webcontrol_localhost' to OFF.
Set 'quality' to 100.
Set 'width' & 'height' to 640 & 480.
Set 'post_capture' to 5.
Press ctrl + x to exit. Type y to save and enter to conform.
Again type in the command 'sudo nano /etc/default/motion ' and press enter.

Set ' start_motion_daemon ' to yes. Save and exit.

First of all your have to restart the motion software. To do it type in the command 'sudo service motion restart' and press enter.

Again type in the command 'sudo motion' and press enter. Now your server is ready.

Now open up your browser. Type in the IP address of your raspberry Pi and the port number in this way:

192.168.0.107:8081 (First there is the IP address, then a ':', then the port number). Press Enter.
